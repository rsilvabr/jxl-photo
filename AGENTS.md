# jxl-photo — agent notes

## Do NOT touch (dead code)
- `jxl_jpeg_transcoder_HDR.py` and `hdr/` — abandoned HDR side project, kept
  untracked at the repo root (gitignored). Do not read, edit, analyze, or
  commit these files.
- `deprecated/` — superseded scripts, tracked only for history. Out of scope
  for audits, refactors and edits.
- `claude/` — stale copies of the active scripts from the v1.7.0 era, kept
  untracked at the repo root (gitignored). They still match on a repo-wide
  grep, so treat any hit there as noise: the duplicated-helper rule below means
  a fix applied to `claude/jxl_*.py` by mistake would look right and do nothing.

## Active scripts
- `jxl_tiff_encoder.py` — TIFF → JXL (uses `cjxl`)
- `jxl_tiff_decoder.py` — JXL → TIFF (uses `djxl`)
- `jxl_jpeg_transcoder.py` — JPEG↔JXL lossless + JXL→JPEG/PNG lossy
- `jxl_photo.py` — interactive wrapper that invokes the 3 scripts via subprocess

## Architecture gotchas
- **Each manifest entry runs as a SEPARATE child process.** A child's own safety
  checks (`_abort_on_duplicate_outputs`, the output-vs-input collision guard)
  can therefore never see a problem that spans two entries — those guards have
  to live in the wrapper. Two v1.8.1 bugs came from exactly this blind spot.
- **Mode 8 is the only mode that deletes sources.** Every delete path is gated
  by an integrity check plus (for JPEG recovery) `djxl --reconstruct_jpeg` or a
  same-run MD5 match. Keep those gates fail-CLOSED: an unverifiable output must
  block deletion, never be waved through.
- **Re-run defaults differ per script**: the TIFF encoder/decoder default to
  smart sync (source newer than output), the JPEG transcoder skips existing
  outputs. Not a bug — documented in each README.
- Helper functions are deliberately duplicated across the four scripts
  (`_marker_matches`, `_replace_suffix_token`, `_is_relative_to`,
  `_abort_on_duplicate_outputs`, `_run_exiftool_argfile`, `_tool_version`) so
  each stays standalone. Fix bugs in ALL copies.

## Verification
- After editing any script, run `python -m py_compile` on the changed files.
- Tests: `pytest tests/`
- Prefer verifying real behavior against real photos over reasoning alone — the
  test suite is synthetic/mocked, so codec-path bugs (ICC, bit depth,
  multi-page, channel counts) only show up against actual files.
- When fixing a bug, prove the new regression test **fails against the pre-fix
  code**, not merely that it passes after. Extract the old file rather than
  stashing:
  ```
  git show HEAD:jxl_photo.py > <tmpdir>/jxl_photo.py   # then run the test there
  ```
  Do **not** use `git stash` for this: the repo can carry unrelated stashes, and
  a `stash pop` may apply the wrong one and leave a merge conflict.

## Docs map
- `README.md` — current release, install, quick start
- `docs/README_jxl_tiff_encoder.md`, `docs/README_jxl_tiff_decoder.md`,
  `docs/README_jxl_jpeg_transcoder.md` — per-script CLI, settings and modes
- `docs/README_jxl_tools.md` — the interactive wrapper
- `docs/jxl_color_internals.md` — XYB, ICC blobs vs native primaries
- `docs/bug_tracking_since_v1.0.md` — every fix since v1.0
- `docs/version_history.md` — "What's New" for releases before v1.8
- `docs/RELEASE_v*.md` — gitignored; local drafts to paste into GitHub Releases

## Releases
- Stable tags: `vX.Y.Z` (e.g. `v1.7.1`); betas: `vX.Y.Z_betaN`.
- Commits carry the repo owner's authorship only — **no `Co-Authored-By` or
  `Claude-Session` trailers** (AI assistance is credited in the README's
  Acknowledgments instead, and more than one assistant is used).
